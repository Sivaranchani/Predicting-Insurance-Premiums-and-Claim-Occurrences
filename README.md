# Predicting-Insurance-Premiums-and-Claim-Occurrences
Machine Learning Approaches for Predicting Insurance Premiums and Claim Occurrences
Successfully developed a two-stage ML pipeline for claim occurrence classification and premium prediction.
Feature engineering significantly improved model performance by incorporating derived variables such as population density, driving experience, and vehicle power-to-weight ratio.
Class imbalance in claim occurrence data impacted baseline models, but boosting algorithms effectively improved minority class recall.
Premium prediction models achieved high R² scores and low error metrics, enabling accurate and consistent pricing.
Customer segmentation using clustering revealed distinct risk profiles, providing actionable insights for targeted pricing and marketing.
Insights support risk-based underwriting, more precise reserve allocation, and enhanced fraud detection capabilities.
The project demonstrates how data-driven strategies can improve profitability, customer satisfaction, and competitive positioning in the insurance market.
